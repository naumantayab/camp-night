                    <b>Introduction:</b>
                    <br><br>
                    It is the intention of Outdoor Adventures Inc and Venture Out Resorts (“OAI &amp; VO”), its affiliates, managers,
                    employees, and agents to maintain the highest standards possible in the course of its business. Toward this end,
                    Outdoor Adventures Inc &amp; Venture Out Resorts does not intend to violate the privacy rights or wishes of any
                    person who does not want to be called by our organization. The following policy is mandatory in all solicitations
                    and campaigns by our company.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Do Not Call Policy (TCPA 47 USCS § 227)</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Consumers may request by telephone or in writing, that our company stop calling them and place their name on our
                    company specific Do Not Call list. Although we may ask for their names, address and telephone number, we will accept
                    a request even if the consumer only wishes to provide their telephone number. Consumers have the right to have calls
                    stopped and to be put on our Do Not Call list, even if they are still a customer. The specific reason or severity of
                    the tone of the request is not important. ALL REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED.
                    <br><br>
                    When we receive a request, the telephone number is added to our Do Not Call list within (7) business days. In some
                    cases, it may take up to (14) business days for the consumer’s telephone to be removed from other company wide
                    calling lists. A Do Not Call request stays on our list for at least 5 years. If the consumer moves, changes their
                    telephone or adds additional telephone numbers, the consumer must provide us with the new telephone number in order
                    for us to prevent calls to that number. We will not share the information customers provide without their prior
                    permission, except affiliated companies or subsidiaries.
                    <br><br>
                    Other companies may perform telemarketing services on our behalf. In this case, we will also forward our updated Do
                    Not Call list(s) to these companies.
                    <br><br>
                    All employees and agents that engage in outbound telephone solicitation are trained in this policy and made aware of
                    these procedures before they are allowed to place calls to consumers. Customer Service representatives are also
                    trained pursuant to this policy before they are allowed to take calls from customers. Managers, supervisors, or
                    trainers must review this policy with these employees annually. Re-certification of training occurs on an as needed
                    basis.
                    <br><br>
                    If the consumer notifies us that they have received a telephone call from us after they have already requested to be
                    placed on our Do Not Call list, we will apologize for the intrusion and have a manager or supervisor investigate.
                    The manager or supervisor will also personally confirm that the telephone number is on the Do Not Call list. Upon
                    request, we will mail the consumer a confirmation that their telephone number is on the list.
                    <br><br>
                    The Federal Trade Commission offers a free service to consumers that allow them to place their residential phone
                    number on a National Do Not Call Registry. This service will reduce the number of telemarketing calls received.
                    Consumers may add their residential phone number to the list either by calling 888-382-1222 or through the internet
                    at www.donotcall.gov. It may take several weeks before they notice a reduction in calls.
                    <br><br>
                    The methods and procedures in this Do Not Call policy are reviewed by Outdoor Adventures Inc &amp; Venture Out
                    Resorts Legal team on a regular basis, as the TCPA atmosphere is constantly changing. As the interpretation of the
                    TCPA changes, so will Outdoor Adventures Inc &amp; Venture Out Resorts Do Not Call Policy.

                    telemarketer. The DNC request file will minimally contain the consumer’s 10-digit telephone number and the date of
                    request. Any consumer complaints regarding repeat calls subsequent to a DNC request will be reported to Outdoor
                    Adventures Inc &amp; Venture Out Resorts Do Not Call Administrator. Consumer requests for a copy of our DNC policy
                    will be fulfilled by registered mail within 14 business days. Records of this action will be forwarded to our Do Not
                    Call Administrator.

                    <b>Procedures for employees:</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Employees who receive a written, e-mail or telephone DNC request will enter the DNC request in the following manner:
                    • The request will be forwarded to our Do Not Call administrator who is responsible for maintaining the internal DNC
                    list.
                    • The Do Not Call administrator will log the phone number and date of the request.
                    • At the end of the day, the Do Not Call administrator will compile all of the requests from that day, and forward
                    them to our 3rd party telemarketer, as well as, our Do Not Call Administrator.
                    • Both Outdoor Adventures Inc &amp; Venture Out Resorts and its telemarketers will honor the request for 5 years
                    after the request is made.
                    <br><br>
                    Requests for our DNC Policy will only be fulfilled by US mail. Policies must be sent within 14 business days of
                    consumer’s request. If someone asks for a copy of our DNC policy, that request will be forwarded to our Do Not Call
                    administrator, immediately. The Do Not Call administrator shall print a copy of our policy within 14 business days
                    and mail it by US mail to the requestor at the address provided. The date of mailing shall be logged in the internal
                    DNC spreadsheet.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Established Business Relationship (EBR) Calls:</b>
                    <br><br>
                    During calling campaigns to our existing customers, someone may express concern that we are calling them even though
                    they have placed their number on the national or state DNC list. Many customers do not understand that calls to them
                    are exempt (within regulatory parameters) from the DNC rules as long as they have not previously asked to be placed
                    on our internal DNC list.
                    <br><br>
